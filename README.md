# phd-lowcode-prototypes
This repository contains simple prototypes showcasing skills in model checking and compiler design for low-code/no-code platforms.
# Projects
# Simple CTL Model Checker (CTL_checker(Light_Switch_case).ipynb)
* A Python model checker for CTL, verifying if a light switch can reach the "On" state (EF(On)).
* Demonstrates formal verification for low-code workflows.

# Simple Assignment Compiler (Lexical Analysis(Toke Identification).ipynb)
* A Python compiler for Token identification in a give sample code, covering lexical analysis, parsing, and intermediate code generation(later to be added).
* Shows ability to translate low-code inputs into executable code.

# Usage
* Run python CTL_checker(Light_Switch_case).ipynb to test the model checker.
* Run python Lexical Analysis(Toke Identification).ipynb for token identification.
# Requirements: Python 3.x.

# Purpose
These beginner-friendly project demonstrating foundational skills in system verification and code generation, relevant to low-code/no-code platforms.
